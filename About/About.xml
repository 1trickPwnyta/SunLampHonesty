This mod adds a button to auto-place hydroponic blueprints around a sun lamp that maximizes the benefit of the lit area.

=== Formerly known as Sun Lamp Honesty ===
Before the sun lamp light radius bug was fixed, sun lamps as of the release of 1.5 produced more brightly lit (100%) area than intended. This mod increased the drawn light radius to match.

=== Updates ===
05/24/2024: Change the name of the mod, remove functionality related to sun lamp light radius bug that has now been fixed.
